Here's what I found ðŸ‘‡ 

1. People aged 56-70 bought the most products, and men in this age group had a higher rate of buying products. 
2. Those under 25 bought the least amount of products but gave the highest average rating.
3. Customers have purchased products from the clothing category the most.
4. If the discount is not given, the customer prefers the 'free shipping' delivery service more.
5. Customers preferred credit card payment method for purchasing the most products. Also PayPal and Hand Cash percentages are pretty close.
6. Customers purchased the most products during the fall season.
7. Overall average rating is 3.75 

âœ… What we should do ðŸ‘‡ 
âœ” Looking at the average rating, we can assume that customers are not very happy to buy products from here.

âœ” Although customers buy more products in spring and winter seasons, we can use new strategies in seasons where the purchase rate of products is lower.

âœ” Other age groups have lower purchase rates. We can keep the products according to their needs.

âœ” Customers buy products only from clothing category more than other categories. New strategies can be used here to increase product value and customer attention in other categories.
